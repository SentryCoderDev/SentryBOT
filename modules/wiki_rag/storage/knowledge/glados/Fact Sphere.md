— **Fact Sphere**

”  
  
The **Fact Sphere** is a corrupted  personality core  that appears in the
single-player campaign of _ Portal 2  _ .

Fact is one of the cores retrieved by  GLaDOS  for  Chell  to attach onto
Wheatley  , in order to initiate a core transfer procedure via corrupting his
control of the  central core  body.

The Fact Sphere speaks like a stereotypical "know-it-all", spending most of
its time rapidly rattling off various facts. While a small portion of the
listed facts are  true  , most of them are  incorrect  and downright
illogical  . (Sometimes altering  true facts  into  nonsense  )

The Fact Sphere, along with all the corrupted cores, is voiced by  Nolan North
.
