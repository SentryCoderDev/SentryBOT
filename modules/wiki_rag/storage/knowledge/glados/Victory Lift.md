##  Function

The primary function of the Victory Lift is to allow the player access to
areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. Victory Lifts are traditionally
activated when the corresponding  Button  is activated by the player, and will
rise when the player stands on them. Some Victory Lifts do not require the
player to activate them, and these platforms are usually activated upon
completion of a  Test Chamber  . Victory Lifts will usually (but not always)
descend when a player has disembarked the lift.
