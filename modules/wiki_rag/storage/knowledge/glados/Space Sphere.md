— The **Space Sphere**

”  
  
The **Space Sphere** (more commonly known as the **Space Core** ) is a
corrupted  personality core  of male programming who first appears in _ Portal
2  _ .  He is the first of three cores attached to  Wheatley  by  Chell  in
order to initiate a Core Transfer Procedure.

The Space Sphere is an example of a  personality core  that went insane.
Because of this, the Space Sphere speaks in a hyperactive manner, constantly
talking about his infatuation with outer space and how he would like to one
day go to space.  His dream of going to space is fulfilled after he gets
sucked through a  portal  that sends him and Wheatley into space. However, a
small portion of his dialogue states that he eventually gets bored of space
and wants to return to Earth. After the song "Want You Gone" at the end of the
game, the Space Sphere can be seen along with  Wheatley  .

The Space Sphere, along with all the corrupted cores, is voiced by  Nolan
North  .
