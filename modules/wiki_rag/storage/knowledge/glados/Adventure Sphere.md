— **Adventure Sphere** to Chell

”  
  
The **Adventure Sphere** (who calls himself " **Rick** ") is a corrupted
personality core  of male programming who appears in the single-player
campaign of _ Portal 2  _ .

He is one of the cores retrieved by  GLaDOS  for  Chell  to attach onto
Wheatley  , in attempt to initiate a core transfer procedure via corrupting
his control of the  central core  body.

The Adventure Sphere speaks in the manner of a stereotypical "tough guy",
spending most of his time boasting about his bravery and excitement for
danger. Upon seeing  Chell  , he flirts with her and makes increasingly
chauvinistic comments. He even tries (but to no avail) to convince Chell to
take a "lady break"  while he deals with Wheatley by himself  .

Rick, along with the other corrupted cores and the  defective turrets  , is
voiced by  Nolan North  .
