##  Uses

Buttons are present in virtually all test chambers and, when activated,
trigger a variety of effects. Buttons can either control the flow of Excursion
Funnels, open and close hatches, release  Weighted Storage Cubes  , or even
open and close the gate leading to the exit. It's up to the player to figure
out how and when to use the button, or buttons, in order to proceed.

##  Buttons

###  1500 Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button

The ' _1500 Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button_
is a receptacle that can be triggered by the weights of player characters,
Weighted Storage Cubes  ,  Edgeless Safety Cubes  , and  Frankenturrets  . The
button was introduced in _Portal_ and remained prevalent in _Portal 2_ .

An older prototype variant from the 50-70s era of the Super Buttons can be
seen in the _Portal 2_ single-player chapters _The Fall_ and _The Reunion_ .

###  Weighted Storage Cube Receptacle

**Weighted Storage Cube Receptacles** , as obvious by its name, serves as a
receptacle only for the  Weighted Storage Cubes  , even though it can also
activate using  Weighted Companion Cubes  and  Discouragement Redirection
Cubes  . This receptacle is only present in the co-op campaign of _Portal 2_ ,
though it is available in the  Puzzle Creator  .

The Storage Cube must be placed securely inside the receptacle in order for
test subjects to proceed. Although its appearance is similar to the  Super
Button  , it cannot be activated by the weight of test subjects or any other
objects being placed upon it.

###  Edgeless Safety Cube Receptacle

The Edgeless Safety Cube Receptacle is a receptacle for the  Edgeless Safety
Cube  , introduced in _Portal 2_ . The Cube must be placed securely inside the
receptacle in order for the player to proceed.

Edgeless Safety Cubes and their receptacles only appear as testing elements in
the game's cooperative campaign and the  Perpetual Testing Initiative  .
However, an Edgeless Safety Cube can be seen among the "garbage" in  Portal 2
Chapter 2 Test Chamber 6  .

###  Contraption Cube Receptacle

The Contraption Cube Receptacle is exclusively featured in the  educational
version of Portal 2  . Although it is designed for the  Contraption Cube  ,
the Receptacle will not recognize the Contraption Cube or activate any puzzle
elements which are connected with it. Additionally, it appears entirely black
in-game, when the model itself has different colors.

###  One-Touch Super Button

The One-Touch Super Button appears in  Bridge Constructor Portal  and is a
blue variant of the normal Super Button that stays powered after being pressed
at least once.

##  Puzzle Creator  item properties

  * **Entity cost:** 3 
  * **Connections:** This item supports outputs, which activate when the button is pressed and deactivate when it is unpressed. _Connect to..._ is used to connect this item to another, via inputs or outputs. _Connection visibility_ controls the visibility of this connection, and _Remove connections_ can be used to remove an existing connection. 
  * **Button Type:** Used to select between Weighted, Cube and Sphere buttons. In the  educational version  , it also allows switching to the Contraption Cube receptacle. 
  * **Toggle Stopwatch:** Unknown, only present in educational version. Possibly related to the timer functionality present in that version. 

##  Notes

  * In the  Portal  Test Chamber 16  ,  turrets  can activate a button. This is the only occurrence of this in the game.
