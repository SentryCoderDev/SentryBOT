”  
  
The **Advanced Knee Replacement** was a safety device introduced in _ Portal
_ . The device was created by  Aperture Science  in order to keep Test
Subjects from injuring themselves when falling from great heights.

These Knee Replacements were worn by  Chell  , the protagonist of _Portal_ ,
until she is later fitted with the  Long Fall Boots  in _ Portal 2  _ .

##  Overview

The Replacements serve the purpose of protecting human Test Subjects from even
the slightest bit of harm regardless how far they have fallen, even from
terminal velocity, and additionally to prevent the  Handheld Portal Device
from inflicting damage. This purpose was later succeeded by the  Long Fall
Boots  introduced in the single-player campaign of _Portal 2_ .

Prior to the events of _Portal 2_ in the _ Portal 2: Lab Rat  _ comic,  Chell
was dragged back into the facility by the  Party Escort Bot  , breaking her
Advanced Knee Replacements in the process.  These were ultimately replaced by
the  Long Fall Boots  .
