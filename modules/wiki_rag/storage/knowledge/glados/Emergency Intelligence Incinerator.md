The **Emergency Intelligence Incinerator** is a chute that leads directly to a
series of furnaces deep within the  Aperture Science  Facility. Incinerators
appear infrequently, but appear in specific locations during both  Portal  and
Portal 2  . Incinerators play a key role during _Portal_ and appear only
twice, and also appear briefly in _Portal 2_ early on in the game.

##  Function

The purpose of the Incinerator is to safely and efficiently dispose Aperture
Science technologies by providing easy access to the furnaces.  In _Portal_ ,
the player is forced to incinerate their  Companion Cube  in order to progress
to the next test. During the boss battle with GLaDOS, the player must pick up
Personality Cores  dislodged from GLaDOS and place them in the Incinerator in
order to defeat her.
