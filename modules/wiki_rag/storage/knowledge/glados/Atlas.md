##  Biography

Atlas is a blue eyed  Core  with a basic design as a typical rounded Core, and
is portrayed to have somewhat more masculinity in its programming than in
P-body.  GLaDOS had created the Cooperative Testing Initiative after her
awakening in _Portal 2_ , as a means of replacing  Chell  as her only Test
Subject.  Along with  P-body  , the two bots are pitted against a series of
tests built by GLaDOS herself, utilizing the many different  mechanics
previously encountered by Chell from the game's single-player campaign.

It was later revealed by GLaDOS that Atlas and P-body's Cores are programmed
specifically to do nothing more but tests.

During the final phases of testing, GLaDOS reveals that, while the Cooperative
Testing Initiative has its uses, she needs human testing for science, not
robots. GLaDOS reveals that there are humans locked away, deep within the
ancient Aperture facilities. There the bots will be tasked with navigating the
old test chambers and unlock the massive vault containing the humans,
seemingly kept in place by some form of cryogenic storage. By doing this, they
'save science.' However, almost immediately after the robots unlock the room
containing the test subjects, they are destroyed. They are eventually rebuilt
and, during the credits, Atlas sits at a computer desk and watches P-body
playing on a conveyor belt.
