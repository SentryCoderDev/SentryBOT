Oh, in case you got covered in that repulsion gel, here's some advice the lab
boys gave me: [sound of rustling pages] " **Do not** get covered in the
repulsion gel."

**Repulsion Gel** is a light blue substance that repels objects, and any
player or object that hits a surface coated with Replusion Gel will bounce
off. Jumping off such a surface launches the player higher than a normal jump,
and the height of the jump is proportional to the distance a player falls
before rebounding from the Gel. This allows the player to reach higher ledges
and platforms by falling from a greater height. When used in combination of
Propulsion Gel  , the player can travel a considerable distance, which is
vital in situations in which  Portals  cannot be used. Objects such as
Storage Cubes  and  Turrets  can be covered in Repulsion Gel, which causes
them to bounce around erratically.

Crouching will negate the effects of Repulsion Gel, and is useful for
situations in which players find it difficult to stop bouncing and require
more control over their movements.

##  Function

Repulsion Gel can be applied to virtually any surface, and can be placed in
different locations through the use of carefully-placed portals. The Gel is
most useful when applied to surfaces at the bottom of pits, at the edges of
large gaps, or to closely-spaced parallel walls, which allows the player to
move between them by bouncing from one to the other. The Gel is primarily used
to circumvent large gaps, and/or cover considerable distances.
