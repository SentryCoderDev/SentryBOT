”  
  
The ** Aperture Science  Aerial Faith Plate ** ( **Faith Plate** , **jump
pad** or **launchpad** ), is a mechanism introduced in _ Portal 2  _ . This
device launches players over a gap or to a specific destination at a set
velocity and height. It can be used in conjunction with  portals  , and the
Plate's ability to preserve the velocity of the user makes it an effective
means of travel to far or otherwise inaccessible places.

Aerial Faith Plates can also launch any object that is placed on them. Their
mechanism is designed so that the player is launched either directly upward,
forward or backward in motion.  There is one occasion in which an Aerial Faith
Plate launches you sideways, during the final chapters of the game.

In  Portal 2 - Education Version  , the **Aerial Faith Plate** can generate an
impulse with a specific amount of force (1-99N) and in a precise direction
(0-90°).
