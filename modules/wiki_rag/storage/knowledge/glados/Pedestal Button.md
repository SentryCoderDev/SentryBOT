**Pedestal Button** s are a game  mechanic  used within the _Portal_ series.
They can be found very frequently throughout  Test Chambers  and are primarily
used to allow the player to trigger or toggle a particular function. They can
be activated with the "Use" key (  E  by default  ).

##  Uses

Pedestal Buttons are used for multiple purposes to initiate a particular
action. More common uses include the dropping of a  Cube  (and fizzling of the
previous cube if present), activating a  Gel  pipeline or opening a door. They
can also be timer-based, where the action (for example, extending a platform)
is only activated for a specific length of time.

Exclusively in _Portal: Still Alive_ for the Xbox 360, there is an alternate
pedestal button design which is white with red lights and an icon of a cube
with a skull on the button itself. This design is used for pedestal buttons
connected to cube droppers, to indicate that pressing the button will destroy
the previous cube. The button itself behaves identically to a regular pedestal
button. This button design does not appear in _Portal 2_ or the Nintendo
Switch versions of the _Portal: Still Alive_ levels, both of which replace
them with regular pedestal buttons.
