Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the

— **GLaDOS**

”  
  
The **Morality Core** is a  personality core  that appears in _ Portal  _ ,
and  Portal 2: Lab Rat  . It is one of many cores that was attached to  GLaDOS
in order to regulate her behavior. It was programmed to prevent her from doing
unethical deeds, acting as an artificial conscience. When  Doug Rattmann
first sees the Morality Core, he doubts its capability to restrain GLaDOS,
saying "You can always ignore your conscience".  He turns out to be correct,
as despite the Morality Core being attached, GLaDOS floods Aperture with
neurotoxin  anyway.

At the end of _Portal_ , it falls off of  GLaDOS  ' body, possibly
intentionally. GLaDOS repeatedly tells Chell not to touch it, but she
disregards this advice and destroys it in an  Emergency Intelligence
Incinerator  . When incinerated, it is then known by GLaDOS as the  "Aperture
Science Thing We Don't Know What It Does"  . With her conscience removed,
GLaDOS is free to flood  her chamber  with neurotoxin.
