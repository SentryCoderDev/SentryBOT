##  Cubes

###  Weighted Storage Cube

The **Weighted Storage Cube** was first introduced in _Portal_ , and remains
prevalent in _Portal 2_ . In _Portal 2_ however, the cube is given a blue ring
in the center instead of a blue cross, and can turn yellow when placed upon a
Super Button  .

###  Weighted Companion Cube

Main article:  Weighted Companion Cube  __

The **Weighted Companion Cube** was first introduced in _Portal_ , and remains
prevalent in _Portal 2_ . Similar to the Weighted Storage Cube, the Companion
Cube possesses a different design in _Portal 2_ . The Cube functions in the
same way as a Weighted Storage Cube, being differentiated to encourage test
subjects to feel attached to the Cube.  A feature to the new Companion Cube in
_Portal 2_ is that it is able to sing.

###  Edgeless Safety Cube

The **Edgeless Safety Cube** was officially introduced in _Portal 2_ , where
it is used only in the  co-op  campaign. However, it also appears once in the
single-player campaign as garbage. The entire name is given out of irony,
however it still retains the coloring scheme and patterns present in the
designs of the other cubes.

The Edgeless Safety Cube did have an appearance in a _Portal_ Challenge Map
and a _Portal: Still Alive_ Map, however it did not have a notable name and
also did not have an accompanying receptacle, thus is not widely considered to
have its first appearance until _Portal 2_ .

This Item appears in Chapter 2 chamber 6, while GLaDOS is cleaning out the
cube dispenser, where 2 of them fall out amongst other garbage.

###  Discouragement Redirection Cube

Main article:  Discouragement Redirection Cube  __

The **Discouragement Redirection Cube** was introduced in _Portal 2_ . Its
main purpose is to redirect the  Thermal Discouragement Beam  to other places
or through  portals  if necessary. However, the cube has a second use as a
Weighted Storage Cube, as it can be used to activate the Heavy-Duty Super
Button.

###  Frankenturret

Main article:  Frankenturret  __

**Frankenturrets** are  Sentry Turret  and  Weighted Storage Cube  hybrids
created by  Wheatley  in order to complete test chambers when he had no test
subjects. They are present in the single-player chapters, _The Itch_ and _The
Part Where He Kills You_ .

Frankenturrets do not speak, and instead emits incomprehensible chirping
sounds.  They act as Wheatley's replacement for Storage Cubes, but their
behavior is different.  Frankenturrets will hop around aimlessly while not
placed on a button. When picked up by  Chell  or put on a button, they retract
their legs inside their cubes. If they fall over on their sides or upside
down, they will wave their legs trying to get up.

In the Pre-1 chamber of chapter 8, Potato-GLaDOS will attempt to stun Wheatley
with a paradox that he fails to understand. It can be noted that when Potato-
GLaDOS speaks the paradox, all of the Frankenturrets in the room will fold up
their legs, twitch violently, emit electrical sparks and have their pupils
rapidly change size,  which indicates they are, at least, partially capable of
understanding words.

###  Scalable Cube

The **Scalable Cube** is exclusively featured in the  Portal 2 Sixense DLC
Test Chambers. The only way to scale the Cube is with the  Razer Hydra
Controllers, a feature supported by the  Portal Gun  in the DLC. The size of
the Cube changes simultaneously with its mass. The Scalable Cube can be used
to build bridges between gaps or to crush  Turrets  .

###  Contraption Cube

The **Contraption Cube** is exclusively featured in the  Portal 2 -
Educational Version  Puzzle Creator  . It has adjustable mass, friction and
elasticity. The minimum mass is 1kg, maximum mass is 85kg. There are 5 levels
for friction: frictionless, slippery, normal, sticky and very sticky. There
are also 5 levels for elasticity: no rebound, slight rebound, normal, bouncy,
very bouncy. The default settings for the Contraption Cube are 40kg,
frictionless, and no rebound. Different settings cause the cube to take on
slightly different appearances. It has 2,125 possible variations. It has its
own button, the Contraption Cube Receptacle.

###  Schrödinger cubes

The **Schrödinger cubes** are featured in the _Portal 2: Community Edition_
and _Portal: Revolution_ . These cubes behave like Discouragement Redirection
Cubes. When a laser enters either cube, it always exits from the other cube.
It doesn't matter which cube the laser enters; it will always come out from
the opposite one.

###  Skull Cube

The **skull cube** is an alternate design for the regular Weighted Storage
Cube in which the Aperture logo is replaced by a crudely drawn skull. It is
present in the game files of _ Portal: Still Alive  _ , but does not appear
in-game. Due to a similar design existing for  pedestal buttons  that are
connected to cube droppers, is is widely believed that said cube droppers
would have originally dispensed skull cubes, but that this was cut due to
players being confused into thinking the cubes had a unique function.

The unofficial PC port of _Still Alive_ reimplements the skull cubes, but they
are _not_ used in any official version of the game.

  

##  Cubes Outside of the Portal Series

###  Dota 2 Cube

The **Dota 2 Cube** is a Portal inspired cube appearing in the art for the
Dota 2 "Portal" hud skin.

##  Puzzle Creator  item properties

  * **Entity Cost:** 4 (no dropper), 17 (with dropper) Dropperless entity cost taken from Valve Developer Community. Entity cost with dropper taken from BEE2 as VDC did not have it. This may not be accurate as BEE2 modifies cube droppers, which may change the ent count. 
  * **Connections:** This item supports inputs, which drop the cube when activated and fizzle the previous cube (therefore this is only present when the dropper is enabled). _Connect to..._ is used to connect this item to another, via inputs or outputs. _Connection visibility_ controls the visibility of this connection, and _Remove connections_ is used to remove existing connections. 
  * **Cube Type:** Allows switching between Weighted, Companion, Reflection, Sphere and Franken cubes. The  education edition  also allows switching to the Contraption Cube. 
  * **Dropper Enabled:** This checkbox controls whether the cube has a dropper or not. If unchecked, the cube will be dropperless. 
  * **Auto-drop First Cube:** This checkbox controls whether the dropper would automatically drop the first cube upon entering the map. If unchecked, it will not drop the first cube, requiring you to activate it's input via a  Pedestal Button  . 
  * **Auto-respawn cube:** This checkbox controls whether the dropper will respawn the cube. If unchecked, the cube will not automatically respawn, requiring you to activate its input via a Pedestal Button.
