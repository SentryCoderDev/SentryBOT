A Test Chamber door

**Test Chambers** are a vital part of the _Portal_ series and the  Aperture
Science  Enrichment Center. Via the  Security Cameras  fixed onto the walls of
test chambers at various points,  GLaDOS  can track a test subject's movements
and progress.

There are hundreds and more test chambers throughout the Enrichment Center,
which can be easily reconfigured and recycled to form another new test
chamber. In _Portal 2_ , these chambers can be swiftly created by GLaDOS with
the usage of robotic arms carrying  panels  and combining them with other
panels to form a ceiling, floor, and walls.

Aesthetically, these chambers bear resemblance to a hospital with its sterile
environment; due to the lighting used within chambers, and the black and white
coloring of the walls, floors, and ceilings.

##  Design/Styles

###  Portal

####  Clinical

The clinical look

Every  Portal  chamber (not including the escape sequences) has a distinct and
recognizable look - white, sterile rooms with an atmosphere that conveys the
emotions of loneliness. Most of the details seem a little blurry, possibly
done on purpose to create a dusty, old atmosphere and immerse the player
better into the experience.

###  Portal 2

####  "Remastered" clinical

Remastered clinical look

Sections of  Portal 2  chambers that look like the chambers from  Portal  ,
but made to fit the theme of the game and more refreshed and modern compared
to the looks of _Portal_ . The panels are more reflective, polished, and
easily recognizable to the average player. Every item design is revamped to
suit the game's modernistic theme.

Chapters that this style appears in: "The Surprise", "Team Building" (Co-op),
"Mass and Velocity" (Co-op), "Excursion Funnels" (Co-op) and the  Perpetual
Testing Initiative

####  Decayed/ruined

Decayed, ruined chambers

This type of level design can be seen mostly in the first chapter of Portal 2,
where the player explores the devastating designs of destroyed levels.
Outgrown leaves and grass dominate over the ruined panels mostly missing the
final touch, just having the metal holder rim visible on the surface. The
ruins don't seem a big roadblock to the player, but might impose a sort of
emotional feeling to the player  because the reason why Aperture has gone
decayed is the side effect of the player's actions in the first game, and
might find themselves guilty, even though they shouldn't be.

Chapters that this style appears in: "The Courtesy Call" and "Hard-Light
Surfaces"(Co-op)

####  Reconstructing

GLaDOS's reconstructed test

This type of level design can be seen after you reboot  GLaDOS  and she is
cleaning the facility, This style is very similar to the  Overgrown  style
with some exceptions: Foilage is nowhere to be seen, birds can't be heard and
the essential test mechanics(  Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button  ,
Cubes  , etc...) are all clean, Panels can be seen trying to go back to their
designed places(with some failures along the way.) and some panels are dirty
while others are brand new. As you go through the test chambers, the test
chambers have less destruction and more clean Panels until  Portal 2 Chapter 4
Test Chamber 20  where the facility is finally clean.

Chapters that this style appears in: "The Cold Boot", "The Return" and "The
Surprise"

####  50-80's era Aperture

50-80's era design

Through the Portal 2 storyline, the player encounters old-looking levels with
graphics predating the 90's. The so-called  Cave Johnson  levels have a
distinct look no other level design has. Its color use shifts more to the hues
of green, yellow, brown etc., which is quite different to the color scheme all
of the other Portal levels have - the hues of black and white. The contents of
the test chambers' designs are more colorful and noticeable. Almost everything
doesn't cut corners, other than the decorative pipes.

Chapters that this style appears in: "The Fall", "The Reunion", "Mobility
Gels" (Co-op), and "Art Therapy" (Co-op and only the last area of the course)

####  Wheatley's Chaotic Chambers

Wheatley's Test chambers

This is the last type of level design and can be seen in the last two chapters
of the single-player storyline. These test chambers are made by Wheatley and
it's made clear that he doesn't know how to make them. Different chambers that
have nothing to do with the other are mashed together, holes are everywhere in
the walls, and every few seconds an explosion happens (because of the
overheating nuclear reactor that powers the facility). In the latter tests,
fire can be seen in the background. Instead of the normal goo, there are
bottomless pits. The test chambers are full of pipes making it very clear that
Wheatley is putting tests where they weren't supposed to be. Instead of the
normal  Weighted Storage Cubes  there are the  Frankenturrets  , and monitors
are everywhere for Wheatley to talk to Chell and GLaDOS.

Chapters that this style appears in: "The Itch" and "The Part Where  He Kills
You  "

##  Challenge modes

In _ Portal  _ , challenge mode test chambers can be found in the game's
"Bonus Maps" menu option. In _ Portal 2  _ however, the challenge modes can be
played via selecting "Play Challenge Mode" in either single-player or co-op.

The chambers in the challenge mode are identical to the original campaign
versions, only with the implementation of goal-based puzzles. These include
completing the map with the:

  * Least amount of  portals  deployed 
  * Least time elapsed 
  * Least amount of steps taken ( _Available in Portal only_ ) 

In _Portal_ , the stats will be compared to the goal, and if you matched the
number of portals / steps / time to the goal (or got less than it), it will
get harder and harder. In _Portal 2_ , player stats will be saved into the
Steam  leaderboards. This allows the Steam community to keep track of friends
and other players who have beaten them in either least portals created, or
least time taken to complete a test chamber.

##  Advanced chambers

Available only in _Portal_ , these are variants of the test chambers which
have been redesigned with an advanced difficulty curve, for instance by
decreasing the number of portalable surfaces, or by increasing the presence of
Goo  .

Like challenge chambers in _Portal_ , advanced chambers can be played via the
"Bonus Maps" section on the main menu.

The  Portal 2 Sixense MotionPack DLC  contains advanced chambers for _Portal
2_ .
