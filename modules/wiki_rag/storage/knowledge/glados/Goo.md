##  Overview

Goo is usually present within testing chambers in order to provide a penalty
for failure, and to ensure that test subjects are precise with their movements
and positioning of their  portals  .

Almost all objects that have fallen into the goo are irretrievable, with the
only exception being radios because they are light enough to float on it. In
such cases where testing elements like  cubes  are needed to solve a test, a
replacement may be issued immediately if the first one was dropped into the
goo (unless the  dropper  is activated by a button, in which case you may have
to press the button again). On some occasions during _ Portal 2  _ , objects
in the goo can be heard and seen  fizzling  immediately after falling in,
while in most, they will simply be deleted soon after they fall out of sight
and are not being held on to.

Appearance-wise in _ Portal  _ , the goo appears as a mixture of red, green,
and brown-colored liquid with a swirled appearance. As of _Portal 2_ , the goo
appears to be mainly brown, often with smoke swirling around its presence like
in _Portal_ .

Any contact with the goo will result in continuous damage that will eventually
result in killing  Chell  ,  P-body  ,  Atlas  ,  Bendy  or whoever you are
playing as within a few seconds upon contact.
