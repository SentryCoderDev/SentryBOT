A Propulsion Gel emitter.  “

Thank you (off mic) I can't believe I'm thanking these people (on mic) for
staggering your way through Aperture Science's propulsion gel testing. You've
made some real contributions to society for a change, and for that, humanity
is grateful.

**Propulsion Gel** is a bright orange substance that greatly reduces the
friction of objects moving across the surface to which it is applied.
Propulsion Gel also increases velocity, as objects covered in Propulsion Gel
also have their friction reduced, causing them to slide around and be moved
more easily. Used in combination with  Repulsion Gel  , the player can travel
a considerable distance, which is vital in situations in which  Portals
cannot be used.

Crouching will slow the character down while on Propulsion Gel, just like
Crouching stops the character from bouncing on  Repulsion Gel  .

##  Function

Propulsion Gel can be applied to virtually any surface, and can be placed in
different locations through the use of carefully-placed portals. The Gel is
most useful when applied to long, straight areas, as it allows the player to
reach a considerable velocity, thereby allowing the player to jump over large
gaps or move quickly past (or through) objects such as  Crushers  .
