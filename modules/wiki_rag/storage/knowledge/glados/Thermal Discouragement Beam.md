”  
  
The  Thermal Discouragement Beam  (referred to as the " **deadly laser** " by
GLaDOS  ,) is a Test Chamber  mechanic  introduced in _ Portal 2  _ .

The Beam is fired in a straight line from an immovable device built into the
wall or ceiling of a Test Chamber. Each Beam is usually coupled with one
Receptacle, though multiple Beams and/or multiple Receptacles may be present
within a single Test Chamber. Directing the Beam into the Receptacle will
activate certain mechanics that are crucial in reaching the chamber exit. The
Beam can also be used in conjunction with Relays, which are small nodes built
into the floor of some Test Chambers. Relays are activated when the Thermal
Discouragement Beam passes through them, and multiple Relays must often be
activated using a single Beam. Once all Relays are activated, specific Test
Chamber mechanics will be triggered, similarly to the activation of a
Receptacle.

##  Interactions

Thermal Discouragement Beams can be angled in any direction and with high
precision using the  Discouragement Redirection Cube  .

Thermal Discouragement Beams can be angled in predefined directions which
players can't change during the game using  portals  .

Direct a Thermal Discouragement Beam onto  Sentry Turrets  (usually via a
portals  and/or  Weighted Pivot Cube  ), causing it to heat up and explode.

##  Notes

  * Thermal Discouragement Beam can travel through transparent objects such as glass... 

  * Touching the beam while on the ground will make a “sizzle” sound and push the player away, as well as deal a small amount of damage. 
    * Prolonged, repeated exposure to the Beam may result in death of  Chell  ,  Atlas  or  P-body  ... This is hard to do even intentionally with some version.  [  1  ]
