— **Cake Core** on cake

”  
  
The **Cake Core** , also referred to as the **Intelligence Core** , is a
personality core  that appears in _ Portal  _ .

It is one of the cores  Chell  knocks off of  GLaDOS  during the climactic
"battle" at the end of the game. It was later destroyed in an  Emergency
Intelligence Incinerator  .

The Cake Core speaks in a slow, monotonous voice,  and spends its time
reciting a  cake  recipe, which often has  unusual  or potentially  lethal
ingredients. As it speaks, it will roll lazily around, seemingly entranced in
recipe recitation.

The Cake Core is voiced by  Ellen McLain  .

The recipe he gives in  LEGO Dimensions  consists of "fish-shaped solid waste,
a single banana, and a cup of lemonade." These are all included in the actual
cake recipe.
