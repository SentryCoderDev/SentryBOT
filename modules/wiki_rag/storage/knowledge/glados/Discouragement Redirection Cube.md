This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes. I'd just finished
building them before you had your, well, episode. So now we'll both get to see
how they work.

”  
  
**Discouragement Redirection Cubes** are a new type of cube introduced in
_Portal 2_ . Like all cubes, they can be used to hold down  buttons  . They
also have the unique ability to focus a  Thermal Discouragement Beam  and
redirect it through their lens. Each side of the Redirection Cube has a large,
round piece of glass in the center. One of the glass sides is more curved than
the others, being the lens that the Thermal Discouragement Beam is focused out
of when coming into contact with any of the other sides.

In  co-op  mode, when redirecting a beam into receptacles, the beam will auto-
aim into the center of the receptacle when the beam is close enough, making
beam redirection slightly easier.
