**Frankenturrets** (referred to as such in the developer's commentary, no
official name is given, though they could possibly be called "box creatures",
as they are called this in the game's sound files) are hybrids of  Aperture
Science Weighted Storage Cubes  and two  Sentry Turrets  made by  Wheatley
during the course of  Portal 2  .

##  Overview

Wheatley  designed the Frankenturrets to compensate for his lack of test
subjects, having intended to design a cube which could walk on buttons
themselves. However, they are shown to be utterly useless for that purpose,
only wandering around aimlessly and falling over. After their introduction,
they are used in place of normal cubes, with the only major difference between
them and the standard cube being that the Frankenturrets will try to hop away
if placed right-side up. This can be a nuisance in Wheatley's tests, but
placing them so they land on their back negates the problem.
