thought lots of sharp bits welded onto the flat bits.

A Crusher in _Portal 2_ .

The **Crusher** is introduced in _ Portal 2  _ , and is a derivative of
Aperture Science  's  Panel  technology. Crushers are an environmental hazard
present in several test environments. If a test subject makes contact with a
Crusher, they will be forced into the nearest hard surface and killed
instantly. Crushers appear as large grey panels with a number of steel spikes
firmly attached to them.

Crushers become more frequent during the final parts of the game
(particularly in the chapter  _The Part Where He Kills You_ )  , and also
appear frequently in  Cooperative Testing Initiative  .

##  Origin

The crusher first appeared in the  Portal  game trailer trailer, but it was
not added to the final game. It was added in the  Portal: Still Alive
expansion pack as a game mechanic and then reappeared in  Portal 2  . It's use
in  Portal: Still Alive  was not wide and it was used in only a handful of
levels.

##  Function

Any object, including the player, will be perforated instantly upon contact
with a Crusher. When active, a loud crunching noise is emitted in order to
warn the player that they are approaching a Crusher, thereby allowing the
player to avoid them.

In Co-op mode, if the player comes in contact with a Crusher while floating in
an  Excursion Funnel  , the damage caused will be periodic until the player
moves away or dies.
