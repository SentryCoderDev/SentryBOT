Don't get covered by the gel.  “

We haven't entirely nailed down what element it is yet, but I'll tell you
this: It's a lively one, and it does NOT like the human skeleton.

**Gels** are a gameplay  mechanic  officially introduced in _ Portal 2  _ .
They are paint-like liquids that impart different effects when applied to
surfaces  and objects. Gel cannot be applied to transparent surfaces (such as
glass), and will pass through grating (also without painting it). The only
test elements that can be covered in gel are  Cubes  and  Turrets  , and they
cannot be covered in Conversion Gel.

A surface or object can take on the properties of only the gel that coated it
last. For example, a Repulsion Gel-covered cube that hits a drop of Propulsion
Gel will become slippery but stop bouncing.

##  Gels

###  Repulsion Gel

Main article:  Repulsion Gel  __

Repulsion Gel, also called Bounce Gel, is a light blue substance that provides
repelling abilities. Any objects like the  Storage Cubes  and  Turrets  that
hits a surface coated with the Repulsion Gel, will either bounce away from the
gel patch or bounce erratically on its own upon being coated with it. Due to
the effect, the height from which a test subject falls before landing on a
gel-covered surface affects the height of a jump. Test subjects can also use
the Gel to move back and forth between two parallel surfaces rather than
merely be propelled up and down.

###  Propulsion Gel

Main article:  Propulsion Gel  __

Propulsion Gel, also known as Speed Gel, is a light orange substance that
greatly increases object velocity and reduces the friction of objects moving
on the surface(s) it is applied to. Any objects covered in this gel have their
friction reduced, causing objects to slide around across the floor easily.

###  Conversion Gel

Main article:  Conversion Gel  __

A portal-conducting white substance  made from a fibrous moon rock powder  .
It enables test subjects to fire  portals  onto  surfaces  previously
incapable of conducting portals.  Weighted Cubes  and  Turrets  cannot be
coated in Conversion Gel, but any other wall, floor or ceiling materials are
coverable.

###  Cleansing Gel

This gel may appear to be regular water with an ability to wash away other
types of gels off of surfaces and any objects that have been coated. It is
destroyed upon touching anything. It has no special properties in regard of
the gameplay, and as such, does not affect any surfaces other than ones
covered in other gels.

###  Slime

**Slime** or **Sewage** was found only in _ Portal  _ during  Chell  's
escape. While not technically a gel, it does have some properties similar to
gels in _Portal 2_ , such as the slippery effect of running on Propulsion Gel
and an adhesion effect that keeps Chell somewhat stuck on the surface. It has
no emitter, is not used to solve chambers, and it cannot be "painted" onto
surfaces like the gels introduced in _Portal 2_ .

##  Unused/cut gels

###  Adhesion Gel

Main article:  Adhesion Gel  __

Adhesion Gel is a cut gel which was originally meant to allow the player to
walk on walls, similarly to the blue Stick paint in _Tag: The Power of Paint_
, which Portal 2's gel mechanics are based on. The gel was made purple as a
placeholder; it was cut before the developers decided on a final color, so it
remains purple in the final game. The gel was cut because many play testers
experienced motion sickness and disorientation, having to think with portals
while walking on walls and ceilings. Most of the gel's effects were removed in
the final game, except one: cubes coated in Propulsion Gel will not slide
across Adhesion Gel-coated floors, and vice-versa.

The gel was replaced by Reflection Gel in the Peer Review update.

###  Reflection Gel

Main article:  Reflection Gel  __

Reflection Gel replaced Adhesion Gel in the  Peer Review  DLC. It appears the
same color as Conversion Gel when painted on surfaces, and the color of
Propulsion Gel when splatted on the screen. The  Thermal Discouragement Beam
will reflect off of it like a mirror, similar to the  Discouragement
Redirection Cube  . It also retains Adhesion Gel's effect of counteracting
Propulsion Gel.
