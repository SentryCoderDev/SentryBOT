An Excursion Funnel

The **Excursion Funnel** , also known as the **Tractor Beam** , is a game
mechanic  introduced in _Portal 2_ . The mechanism creates a wide cylindrical
beam of blue light that the player may enter or exit at any time. It seems to
defy the laws of gravity, allowing anything/anyone who enters to become
weightless and travel along the path of the Funnel. Anyone or anything caught
inside the Funnel travels in the direction that the Funnel is flowing in,
unless the Funnel is reversed, which is usually accomplished through the
activation of a  button  .

Excursion Funnels can pass through portals and can cross vast distances, and
can, therefore, be used to solve puzzles in which Funnels may not initially
appear to be useful.

Excursion Funnels can also act as a mode of transportation for the player or
objects across large gaps, as well as  Gels  . Gels caught in the Excursion
Funnel will slowly follow the direction of the Funnel until the substance
collides with a wall or until the Funnel is deactivated, making funnels useful
for coating large areas in a short amount of time.
