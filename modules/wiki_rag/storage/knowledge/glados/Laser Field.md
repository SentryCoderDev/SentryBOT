##  Overview

The Laser fields serve as the opposite of the  Material Emancipation Grills
\- any objects can be carried through the beams but test subjects in contact
with it will die instantly.  It only appears once in the single-player
campaign, during the  12th test chamber  in the chapter _The Itch_ .

The  Puzzle Creator  , part of the  Perpetual Testing Initiative  , also has a
working laser field that can easily be placed into community-made testing
chambers.

The precursor to laser fields was first added in  Portal: Still Alive
expansion pack for the Xbox 360. The more polished version returned in  Portal
2  .
