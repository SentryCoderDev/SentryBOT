**Neurotoxin** , comically referred to as **Deadly Neurotoxin** by  GLaDOS  ,
is a gaseous chemical agent that appears in _ Portal  _ and in _ Portal 2  's
_ single-player campaign. Manufactured in the Neurotoxin Production Facility,
neurotoxin  can be ventiled into any part of  Aperture Science  Enrichment
Center and is pumped through a series of emitters.

##  Overview

Neurotoxin is not an environmental hazard in the traditional sense of
gameplay, as it only appears during specific, scripted events in the _Portal_
series, mostly at the game's climax. In the _ Lab Rat  _ comic, it is
confirmed that  GLaDOS  ventilated neurotoxin as a means of killing all
Aperture Science  personnel prior to  Chell  's awakening in _Portal_ , and is
frequently used as an attempt to kill her.  Later on in the single-player
campaign of _Portal 2_ , Wheatley also attempts to kill  Chell  with it.

The entirety of these gases are stored and manufactured in a reinforced tank,
located in the bowels of the Enrichment Center. Eight main hoses allow the gas
to be transferred to any location within the facility.  During the chapter
_The Escape_ , Chell sabotages the system by cutting the eight primary hoses,
thereby destroying the generator.

The variety of neurotoxin used within the Aperture Science facilty is unusual
in that a certain concentration is required before it becomes lethal. Until
the saturation level has been reached, the gas is not lethal and is presumed
to be merely toxic.  It is this delay that provides Chell with the opportunity
to defeat GLaDOS in _Portal_ and later, Wheatley in _Portal 2_ .
