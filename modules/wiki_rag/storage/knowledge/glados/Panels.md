A panel found in _Portal 2_ .

**Panels** are the fundamental building blocks of  Aperture Science  Test
Chambers. Panels can be placed anywhere, and can be used to form walls,
floors, ceilings or even  Crushers  . Because the orientation, angle and
height of Panels can be adjusted as needed, they can be reconfigured in order
to create a near-infinite number of variations. Due to their range of uses and
large number of possible permutations, Panels are an ideal choice for
constructing test chambers, and allow those in charge to create new chambers
with new obstacles and hazards on-the-fly.

##  Overview

Panels are capable of aiding or impeding the player's completion of the task
at hand depending upon their placement. Non-static Panels in test chambers are
usually activated through the use of  Buttons  , which will either add or
remove panels to or from the player's path. For example, a series of Panels
can be used to create a new walkway or staircase, provide a surface upon which
a  portal  can be placed, or to provide a barrier to prevent the loss of
critical items such as  Weighted Storage Cubes  . Panels can be used
effectively in virtually every test, making them very useful for trapping a
Test Subject or shielding the player from a hazard. This mechanic becomes much
more crucial during  Co-op  , as Panels are often present in order to block
one partner from crashing into a hazard, or are used to prevent the duo from
easily accessing a certain area.
