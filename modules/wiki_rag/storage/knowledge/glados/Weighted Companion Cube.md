The **Weighted Companion Cube** (often referred to as the **Companion Cube** )
is a recurring object and pseudo-character in the _Portal_ universe. It
appears almost identical to the  Weighted Storage Cube  but with a pink heart
replacing the  Aperture Science  logo.

In _ Portal  _ , the Companion Cube was given to  Chell  in order to aid her
in completing  Test Chamber 17  .  In order to progress through the exit at
the end of the chamber, the cube was dropped into the  incinerator  to be
"euthanized".  GLaDOS  used this moment to taunt Chell during their
confrontation. However, the Companion Cube can be seen prior to the end
credits next to the  Cake  , suggesting that it survived.

The Companion Cube makes a prominent appearance in the _ Portal 2: Lab Rat  _
comic, in which it speaks with protagonist  Doug Rattmann  . This appears to
reference _Portal_ , in which GLaDOS states that the Companion Cube cannot
speak and, if it does, its advice should be  disregarded  .

In _ Portal 2  _ ,  GLaDOS briefly torments Chell by repeatedly destroying
Companion Cubes in  Test Chamber 7  . It is at this point that GLaDOS claims
that the Cubes are in fact  sentient  , which suggests that they possess some
level or rudimentary intelligence similarly to  Turrets  . The Cube also makes
an appearance in the  Co-op  campaign but is inaccessible, preventing the
player from interacting with it. After Chell leaves the facility upon
completing Portal 2, a scorched Companion Cube is ejected after her. This Cube
is not the newly-designed Portal 2 Companion Cube, but is the same as the cube
from _Portal_ . Valve said that it's the exact same cube the player euthanized
in the first _Portal_ , that is given back to her  [  1  ]  .
